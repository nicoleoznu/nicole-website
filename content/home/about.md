I am a doctoral candidate at Northwestern University, and I will be on the job market in 2022-2023.

I study questions in healthcare and crime, including exploring how patients respond to information about physicians, how price controls impact intimate partner violence, and how whistleblowing impacts labor market outcomes for nurses.
